      <description>Mentor: Cameron Wallace Summary As part of a study for the Port Authority of Vancouver, cargo ship positions reported by their navigation systems were considered. These discrete positions were pieced together into full ship routes which were then used to estimate the amount and distribution of pollution generated by cargo traffic through the port of Vancouver. In the original study, there was difficulty handling missing or erroneous position data. This project is to improve the reconstruction process of ship routes.</description>
