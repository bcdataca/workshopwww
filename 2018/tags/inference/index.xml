      <description>Mentor: Jeff Epstein, Comm100 Summary Description: The data set provided includes thousands of online chat sessions between support and sales agents of a company and their customers or online web visitors. Each chat log includes [chat transcript, duration times, and customer rating]. We’ve identified some business issues/use cases with suggested solutions for you to solve but you are not limited to the following issues or solutions (get creative! See things we don’t see in with the data that would provide real business value):</description>

      <description>Mentor: Keith Wallace, St. Paul&amp;rsquo;s Hospital Summary Cytokines are a broad and loose category of small proteins that are important in cell signaling. Their release has an effect on the behavior of cells around them. The challenge in this problem is to find patterns of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs: genotypes) that beget particular cytokine levels (phenotypes). Part of the data set provided is a list of patients&amp;rsquo; blood work measurements (cytokine levels).</description>

      <title>Interpolating ship paths in the Port of Metro Vancouver.</title>

      <description>Mentor: Cameron Wallace Summary As part of a study for the Port Authority of Vancouver, cargo ship positions reported by their navigation systems were considered. These discrete positions were pieced together into full ship routes which were then used to estimate the amount and distribution of pollution generated by cargo traffic through the port of Vancouver. In the original study, there was difficulty handling missing or erroneous position data. This project is to improve the reconstruction process of ship routes.</description>
