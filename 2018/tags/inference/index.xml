      <description>Mentor: Graham Nelson-Zutter, CloudPBX Summary Canada is a member of the G8 and like other leading industrialized nations it offers relatively high speed and stable internet access to the to the majority of its urban population. As with other G8 citizens, Canadians benefit from all of the modern services that the high speed internet access can provide. Among many other real-time services on the internet, voice-over-IP (VoIP) is quickly becoming a prefered way for Canadians and Canadian businesses to access telephone services.</description>

      <description>Mentor: Keith Walley, St. Paul&amp;rsquo;s Hospital Summary Cytokines are a broad and loose category of small proteins that are important in cell signaling. Their release has an effect on the behavior of cells around them. The challenge in this problem is to find patterns of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs: genotypes) that beget particular cytokine levels (phenotypes). Part of the data set provided is a list of patients&amp;rsquo; blood work measurements (cytokine levels).</description>

      <description>Mentor: David Carlson and Kevin Gao, Comm100 Summary Natural Language Processing (NLP) is being dramatically enhanced by AI and machine learning. We believe NLP is at the tipping point, about to reach a level of performance accuracy that makes widespread commercial applications more dependable. The challenge is in quickly training bots on common lexicon, intent, and reaction. The data set provided includes thousands of online chat sessions between support and sales agents of a company and their customers or online web visitors.</description>

      <description>Mentor: Cameron Wallace Summary As part of a study for the Port Authority of Vancouver, cargo ship positions reported by their navigation systems were considered. These discrete positions were pieced together into full ship routes which were then used to estimate the amount and distribution of pollution generated by cargo traffic through the port of Vancouver. In the original study, there was difficulty handling missing or erroneous position data. This project is to improve the reconstruction process of ship routes.</description>

      <description>Mentor: Liezl Van Wyk and Vien Dang, SSR Mining Summary Innovation challenge Using data to proactively predict Equipment Failure prior to the actual failure event occurs by using equipment production, maintenance &amp;amp; alerts information.
Challenge Description Equipment downtime is the time a piece of equipment is taken out of service for planned or unplanned maintenance work. While downtime is costly in general, unplanned downtime can cost up to seven times more than planned downtime and is disruptive to the production cycle due to its unpredictability.</description>
