      <description>Mentor: Cameron Wallace Summary As part of a study for the Port Authority of Vancouver, cargo ship positions reported by their navigation systems were considered. These discrete positions were pieced together into full ship routes which were then used to estimate the amount and distribution of pollution generated by cargo traffic through the port of Vancouver. In the original study, there was difficulty handling missing or erroneous position data. This project is to improve the reconstruction process of ship routes.</description>

      <description>Mentor: Liezl Van Wyk and Vien Dang, SSR Mining Summary Innovation challenge Using data to proactively predict Equipment Failure prior to the actual failure event occurs by using equipment production, maintenance &amp;amp; alerts information.
Challenge Description Equipment downtime is the time a piece of equipment is taken out of service for planned or unplanned maintenance work. While downtime is costly in general, unplanned downtime can cost up to seven times more than planned downtime and is disruptive to the production cycle due to its unpredictability.</description>
