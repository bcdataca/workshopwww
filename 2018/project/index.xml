      <description>Mentor: Cameron Wallace Summary TBA
Data team notes Each set of data spans approximately one week. Historical records contain many ships with sparsely recorded data (once every five minutes per ship), while Current records store as many points as possible. The goal is to reconstruct full paths from partial information. This problem is ripe for Kalman filters and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.</description>

      <description>Mentor: Junbo Bao, SSR Mining Summary Innovation challenge Using data to proactively predict Equipment Failure prior to the actual failure event occurs by using equipment production, maintenance &amp;amp; alerts information.
Challenge Description Equipment downtime is the time a piece of equipment is taken out of service for planned or unplanned maintenance work. While downtime is costly in general, unplanned downtime can cost up to seven times more than planned downtime and is disruptive to the production cycle due to its unpredictability.</description>
