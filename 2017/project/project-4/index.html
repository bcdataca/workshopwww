<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Canada should be the world leader in coastline management. We have, by
far, the longest coastline of any country and more lakes than the rest
of the world combined. Communities from coast-to-coast-to-coast have
been managing flood risks and supporting important ecosystems for
generations, but much of this knowledge isn’t shared. This is because
data often come with restrictions that limit sharing, and are in a
format that requires expensive and specialized software to
access. We’re trying to change that through an initiative called Smart
Shores that provides high-resolution data and shares it with
communities across BC in a range of formats so that it can be directly
integrated into GIS applications and shared with the public in an
interactive online format.</p>

<p>We are using UAVs (drones) and a powerful RTK GPS unit to create
ultra-high resolution maps of shorelines in BC. This allows us to map
shorelines on-demand in fine detail, at low cost and on-demand. This
means that we can track erosion, sediment transport and storm impacts,
and quickly communicate the implications of this online for
communities and ecosystems. Local governments can use this technology
to assess coastal development and flood mitigation plans, communicate
technical requirements to engineers and planners, and engage the
public in planning for the future of their communities. Environmental
not-for-profits can use it to show the results of their conservation
efforts, and educators can have a powerful tool for teaching about
coastal environments.</p>

<p>We have developed a robust workflow for data collection, processing,
and the creation of interactive real-world environments in virtual
space. However, the interpretation of our data still requires manual
processing to generate most of the value-added analysis that makes
Smart Shores data useful to people. This increases the cost of our
products and makes it more difficult for small communities and
not-for-profits to take full advantage of this technology. This is
where we need your help.</p>

<p>One important feature of the ultra-high resolution data produced by
Smart Shores is that it allows habitat and shoreline changes to be
mapped at a scale that is useful for villages, towns and small but
important coastal ecosystems. Identifying these changes requires that
we can identify micro-habitats and substrate types so that we can
measure how small stretches of coast change over time. The software we
use for mapping can classify different types of landscape points, such
as trees, buildings, rail lines and low vegetation. However, it cannot
differentiate between sand, gravel, small rocks and large flat rocky
surfaces. These materials make up a large portion of coastal areas and
are important for evaluating erosion, wave run-up and habitat change.</p>

<p>Coastal landscapes are constantly changing with sand moving daily,
gravel moving after small-to-moderate storms and small rocks moving
after larger storms. The result is that shorelines are changing every
week, month and year. Our goal is to accurately measure these changes
and create robust predictions for what our shorelines will look like
as climate change continues to shape our coasts – and what the
implications of this are for flooding and conservation. We are looking
for an algorithm that will be able to classify sand, gravel, small
rocks and large rocky surfaces from a point cloud. By developing a
solution that will help us automate the classification of different
substrates along our shores we will be able to provide powerful
analytics at a low cost to small communities in rural areas and the
local not-for-profits that help protect our environment.</p>

<p>We look forward to the opportunity to work with you on this project.</p>
