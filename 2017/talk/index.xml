      <description>Note: the talk might be on time-series modelling instead.
Speaker Bio Dr. Bhushan Gopaluni is a Professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at UBC, working with the Data Analytics and Intelligent Systems lab.
Dr. Gopaluniâ€™s primary research interests are in Process Modeling and Control. He is interested in developing and studying the properties of data-based models for a variety of chemical and biological systems. These systems are typically nonlinear, hybrid and time varying, and their measurements are often noisy and irregular.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Past for Traits that Alter Speciation and Extinction</title>

      <description>Speaker Bio Sarah (Sally) P. Otto. University Killam &amp;amp; CRC (Tier 1) Professor, Department of Zoology &amp;amp; Director, Liber Ero Post-doctoral Program, University of British Columbia; B.Sc. and Ph.D. from Stanford University. Understanding how evolution has led to the remarkable diversity of life is the key motivating force behind my research. Mathematical models allow us to determine which evolutionary transitions are plausible, which are probable, and which are inaccessible. Complementing this theoretical approach, we use experimental evolution to track yeast as they evolve, allowing us to test alternative hypotheses.</description>

      <description>Career panel at Mobify   Summary On the evening of August 16th, BC Data Science workshop participants gathered at Mobify headquarters for a career panel and social event. The panel discussed non-academic career options for mathematicians; how mathematicians should prepare for industry jobs and job interviews; and what differences to expect in industry. More broadly, the panelists discussed career success, personal values, and strategies for achieving career-oriented goals.</description>
