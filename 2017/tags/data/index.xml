      <description>Overview This workshop will host 50 graduate students in mathematics and interested industry members for a two week foray into foundational and crucial elements of the rapidly expanding field of data science.
Prior to the workshop will be a prequel workshop covering requisite aspects of elementary mathematics and programming that will be assumed as background.
The first week of the workshop will kick-off on Monday morning, 8:30 AM, with a catered breakfast at the main location, UBC Robson Square.</description>

      <description>Mentor: Roger Donaldson, Midvale Applied Mathematics Summary Despite our hand in their design, and hence their seemingly deterministic operation, electronic systems grow ever more complex and are often most simply characterized through measurement-driven modeling. This workshop presents measurements of the rate at which bits are produced as output of a compression algorithm for a digital video camera. The data are produced by presenting the camera with a variety of test scenes, and operating it over a variety of settings.</description>
