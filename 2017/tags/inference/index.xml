      <description>Mentor: Borhan Sanandaji Summary  Idea 1: Characterize and visualize the make/model/year distribution in the dataset; extend this by characterizing the conditional distribution over the geographical span of the dataset.
 Idea 2: Determinine the devices in the dataset that have multiple drivers per mojio device
 Idea 3: (Optional) Using any of the existing variables in the dataset or outside resources, forecast the battery voltage of the vehicles.</description>

      <description>Mentor: Cory Simon Summary Different cell types in humans possess approximately the same genome despite having dramatically different functions. Gene regulation is the complex process by which cells selectively synthesize different proteins encoded in their genome. [1] A fundamental understanding of how genes are regulated can lead towards effective treatments for cancers and developmental disorders.
Enhancers are distal regulatory elements that, in conjunction with a promoter, recruit the proteins required to drive transcription of a gene.</description>

      <description>Mentor: Soyean Kim, BC Safety Authority Summary BC Safety Authority’s accident prevention strategy follows a risk based platform, called “bow tie” for ongoing management and prevention of major incidents. The bow tie method draws on the direct experience of safety management team and the data collected from various safety oversight programs in order to identify hazards and to properly incorporate critical controls into management systems. In addition, it raises awareness and improves understanding and risk knowledge of the potential major incidents and the reliance on critical controls that prevent those accidents from occurring.</description>
