      <description>Mentor: Borhan Sanandaji Summary  Idea 1: Characterize and visualize the make/model/year distribution in the dataset; extend this by characterizing the conditional distribution over the geographical span of the dataset.
 Idea 2: Determinine the devices in the dataset that have multiple drivers per mojio device
 Idea 3: (Optional) Using any of the existing variables in the dataset or outside resources, forecast the battery voltage of the vehicles.</description>

      <description>Mentor: Nathan Vadeboncoeur Summary Canada should be the world leader in coastline management. We have, by far, the longest coastline of any country and more lakes than the rest of the world combined. Communities from coast-to-coast-to-coast have been managing flood risks and supporting important ecosystems for generations, but much of this knowledge isnâ€™t shared. This is because data often come with restrictions that limit sharing, and are in a format that requires expensive and specialized software to access.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling of video compression</title>

      <description>Mentor: Roger Donaldson, Midvale Applied Mathematics Summary Despite our hand in their design, and hence their seemingly deterministic operation, electronic systems grow ever more complex and are often most simply characterized through measurement-driven modeling. This workshop presents measurements of the rate at which bits are produced as output of a compression algorithm for a digital video camera. The data are produced by presenting the camera with a variety of test scenes, and operating it over a variety of settings.</description>
