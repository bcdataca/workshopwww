      <description>Mentor: Soyean Kim, BC Safety Authority Summary BC Safety Authority’s accident prevention strategy follows a risk based platform, called “bow tie” for ongoing management and prevention of major incidents. The bow tie method draws on the direct experience of safety management team and the data collected from various safety oversight programs in order to identify hazards and to properly incorporate critical controls into management systems. In addition, it raises awareness and improves understanding and risk knowledge of the potential major incidents and the reliance on critical controls that prevent those accidents from occurring.</description>

      <description>Mentor: Roger Donaldson, Midvale Applied Mathematics Summary Despite our hand in their design, and hence their seemingly deterministic operation, electronic systems grow ever more complex and are often most simply characterized through measurement-driven modeling. This workshop presents measurements of the rate at which bits are produced as output of a compression algorithm for a digital video camera. The data are produced by presenting the camera with a variety of test scenes, and operating it over a variety of settings.</description>
